# Final Project: Sentiment Analysis on Covid-19 Tweets

**Math189Z – Covid-19: Data Analytics and Machine Learning**

*May, 2020*

## About
For my final project in Math189Z, I will conduct sentiment analysis on Tweets regarding the Covid-19 pandemic. In doing so, I hope to gain an understanding, and possibly a predictive method, of determining how the severity of the virus spreads geographically, using the sentiment of Tweets from that region.

The goal of sentiment analysis is to determine the attitude and emotion present in a given form of communication. Sentiment analysis applies natural language processing techniques in order to do so.

## Writing
### Final Paper
The final paper is the [Final_Project.pdf](https://github.com/nico-espinosadice/math189-covid19/blob/master/Project/Final_Paper.pdf) file.

### Project Proposal
The project proposal is the [Project_Proposal.pdf](https://github.com/nico-espinosadice/math189-covid19/blob/master/Project/Project_Proposal.pdf) file.

## Code
The code for this project is located in the [Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/nico-espinosadice/math189-covid19/blob/master/Project/Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb).

### Data
The dataset of Tweets was provided by Professor Gu as part of HMC Math189Z. The data is available [here](https://math189covid19.github.io/resources.html). The original source of the data is unknown at this time.

The Twitter sentiment corpus was downloaded from this [public repository](https://github.com/zfz/twitter_corpus).
