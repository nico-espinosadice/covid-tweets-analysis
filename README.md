## About
For my project, I will conduct sentiment analysis on Tweets regarding the Covid-19 pandemic. In doing so, I hope to gain an understanding, and possibly a predictive method, of determining how the severity of the virus spreads geographically, using the sentiment of Tweets from that region.

The goal of sentiment analysis is to determine the attitude and emotion present in a given form of communication. Sentiment analysis applies natural language processing techniques in order to do so.

## Writing
### Final Paper
The final paper is the [Final_Project.pdf](https://github.com/nico-espinosadice/math189-covid19/blob/master/Project/Final_Paper.pdf) file.

### Project Proposal
The project proposal is the [Project_Proposal.pdf](https://github.com/nico-espinosadice/math189-covid19/blob/master/Project/Project_Proposal.pdf) file.

## Code
