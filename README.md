# Final Project: Sentiment Analysis on Covid-19 Tweets

**Math189Z – Covid-19: Data Analytics and Machine Learning**

## About
For my final project in Math189Z, I conducted sentiment analysis on Tweets regarding the Covid-19 pandemic using a Naive Bayes classifier. Through this project, I examined the relationship between the severity of the virus and its impact on the public's reaction to it, particularly on social media. In doing so, I hoped to develop an understanding of how the public's response – particularly the hysteria many felt as the pandemic approached their area – is correlated to the actual virus's spread.

(The goal of sentiment analysis is to determine the attitude and emotion present in a given form of communication. Sentiment analysis applies natural language processing techniques in order to do so.)

### Data
The dataset of Tweets was provided by Professor Gu as part of HMC Math189Z. The data is available [here](https://math189covid19.github.io/resources.html). The original source of the data is unknown at this time.

The Twitter sentiment corpus was downloaded from this [public repository](https://github.com/zfz/twitter_corpus).
